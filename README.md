# Exploring the Latent Space of StyleGAN
Code used for the Bachelor's Thesis in Artificial Intelligence by Karlijn Bok \

Original code was used to explore the latent space of two pre-trained versions of styleGAN, one trained on the FFHQ database, the other trained on the CelebA-HQ. Representations in latent space were found for 312 input images of the Radboud Faces Dataset (RaFD), after which the representation of identity (39 individuals), gender (20 male, 19 female) and emotion (angry, contemptuous, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised) was investigated.

Two files were altered: 
* `align_images.py`
* `encode_images.py` was turned into `encode_images_ffhq.py` and `encode_images_clba.py`
